cache GC (limit to 1GB, LRU mtime) (tmpreaper?)
sd01
client accept input from stdin (level still an arg)
error flag in fragment to return error status to client
somehow vendor go-bindata
https://github.com/upx/upx in distribution pipeline
getname method? (maybe a setname method too, or just load from env)
hub release script to publish all (alter ansible script to use release)
use github releases with ansible
split up modules a bit
readme -- recommend that `dspa` resolves to broadcaster or single speaker.

# Undecided
repeat message for critical?
say warning/critical/error on that level?
dspa-broadcaster -- via sd01 and/or file and eventually also to ioterminals
dspa-scan -- look for dspa servers, save to .dspa-manifest.txt -- then dspa-client looks in there as alternative to broadcaster or broadcast flag
speak.sh do sox effects pitch -290

speaker + broadcaster could be same executable. Broadcaster could be implicitly running on all speakers... (super simple depoyment!)
